Docker container is a box that containes all the things that my applications needs
to be executed (program, info, application itself), so I can take that box to 
any machine that has Docker installed and run the application without having to do
or think anything else.
I would use it If I work with a group and I need to give to a colleague something
for testing...In case my colleague does not have the same version needed in 
order to run the application, he avoids the problem/additional work of installing
new versions or having problems in the test.  If he runs the app under Docker,
that includes the version required, everything will be working properly and easier.
